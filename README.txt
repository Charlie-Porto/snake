NOTES:
- to build this on my machine, I run `./make/compile_project.sh`. Anyone but me (Charlie Porto)
  must modify the paths in that .sh file in order for that compilation command to work, assuming
  you are working on Unix. For folks using Windows, may God help you in your endeavor to compile
  this.
